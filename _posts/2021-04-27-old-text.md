{: .Section}
## 1 &ensp; Introduction

This has been my first attempt at Jekyll and with such it is likely not too great. I'd like to design this to work a bit more seamlessly aka without inline styling in the page.
        
I imagine this is possible but not too sure how to do it yet. I also want to add more Latex style designs such as designed lists and sub sections etc.

{: .sidenote }
Yay, sidenotes!. If you are on mobile, I will appear inline. If you are using a larger screen, the sidenote will appear to the right of the text.


Sidenotes can be used as an alternative to footnotes, where the user does not have to jump to the bottom of the page to read it. On mobile, click the superscript to reveal the note

{: .sidenote .left }
Yay, sidenotes!. If you are on mobile, I will appear inline. If you are using a larger screen, the sidenote will appear to the right of the text.
